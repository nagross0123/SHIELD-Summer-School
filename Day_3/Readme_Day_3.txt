This folder contains the lecture slides and activities from Day 3 of the Summer School.

Lecture Slides
These lecture slides are courtesy of Marc Swisdak from University of Maryland talking on magnetic reconnection and its relevance to processes in the outer heliosphere.
File ’a’ is a general overview of magnetic reconnection theory with examples from simulations and data.
File ‘b’ specifically shows specific applications of reconnection in the outer-heliosphere. 

Instructions for running lab
This lab allows you to explore magnetic reconnection using the results of PIC code references in the notebooks. It is set up to run in a Google Colab environment.  
1) Create a folder in your Google “My Drive” called “SHIELD” 
[note all caps]
2) Create a copy of the notebooks into that folder.
3) Create a copy of the “PIC_data” folder into the SHIELD folder you created.
4) Check the paths and file names referenced in the notebooks to make sure they match the ones you created.
