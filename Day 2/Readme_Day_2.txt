This folder contains the lecture slides and activities from Day 2 of the Summer School.

These include the lecture slides from Heather Elliott of SWRI and an activity analyzing the variation in the solar wind as the New Horizons spacecraft travels out into the heliosphere.  

Lectures:
The lecture slides from Heather Elliott of SWRI are broken up into two files.  
- Elliott_shield_2025_p1.pdf - Part 1 covering the fundamentals of the "Sun and and Solar Corona", and overall structure in the "Solar Wind in the Inner Heliosphere". 
- Elliott_shield_2025.p2.pdf - Part 2 covers "The Outer Heliosphere" referencing data collected by the New Horizons mission. It primarily reviews the variation in the solar wind parameters as a function of distance from the Sun. The role of Pickup Ions (PUI's) is also considered.

Activity:
There are two Google Colab notebooks; the first is the notebook the participants start with.  The second show a set of results that you might get when you run the exercise. 
- SW_NH_v2.ipynb: This exercise uses plasma data from the New Horizons spacecraft to look at long term variation in the plasma variables and fits it to expected trends. The activity can take the better part of an afternoon.  
- SW_NH_v2_Answers.ipynb: The results from running the previous notebook and responding to the prompts and questions.
