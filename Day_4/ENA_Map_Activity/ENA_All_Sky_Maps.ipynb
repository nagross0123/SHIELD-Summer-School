ENA's are created when a charged particle from the Solar Wind or energetic particles interacts with a neutral atom coming from the interstellar medium. These can exchange an electron from one to the other creating an ENA and a Pickup-Ion (PUI). Since the ENA is neutral, it is not affected by magnetic fields and continues on a ballistic trajectory carrying the information (energy and composition) of the energetic particle population it was created from. The [IBEX mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/ibex/), and its follow on mission [IMAP](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/imap/), are designed to create all-sky maps of ENA flux at various energies.  \n","\n","This notebook allows you to explore the latest release of the all-sky maps from IBEX. To use it, you will need to download that release from the [IBEX Data Repository](https://ibex.princeton.edu/DataRelease) and place it in a convient directory on your Google Drive (The directory with this notebook already contains the data from Data Release 18)."],"metadata":{"id":"83W3qup2WNr9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1: Getting Started (10 Minutes)\n","The next couple of cells setups up the file system and loads some packages that are needed.\n","- It will ask you to log into your Google account.
