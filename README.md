SHIELD Summer School Activity Repository 

The SHIELD Summer School, titled “Plasma Processes at the Edge of the Solar System” (https://shielddrivecenter.com/shield-summer-school/): The summer school was an intensive one-week course in the most challenging plasma processes that drive the structure and dynamics at the Edge of the Solar System.

During the SHIELD Summer School participants experience lectures from leading research scientists working in the outer heliosphere covering plasma processes that are important in understanding the structure of the heliosphere.  Participants also engage in activities that explore data from important missions such as  Voyager, New Horizons, and IBEX, as well as simulation results exploring magnetic reconnection. 

This repository consists of Python notebooks developed for the Goggle Colab environment (which makes them easy to share and run). The notebooks allow users to explore the data or simulation results to gain insight into the physical processes underlying the important processes in the outer heliosphere. 
The overall learning goals activities include:
  - Increasing participant knowledge of the structures in the outer heliosphere
  - Understanding and interpreting global radial trends in the plasma parameters in the outer heliosphere
  - Understanding plasma processes such as magnetic reconnection and turbulence 
  - Being able to see the signatures of these processes in the spacecraft data

Each notebook is broken into small code blocks seperated by explaination and questions.  The questions are intended to prompt exploration.  If you are working on these activities with others then you should discuss your reasoning when answering the questions. If you are working on your own, take the time to write out your results and explainations. 

The following activities are (or will be) available in this repository:
  1) Structures at the edge of the heliosphere - Participants use plots of Voyager 2 plasma data to identify key regions of the outer heliosphere. This activity is presented in two seperate notebooks. The first explores the different regions of the outer heliosphere and the second takes a detailed look at the pressure balance and jump conditions at the termination shock.

  2) Variation of the solar wind in the outer heliosphere - Participants use New Horizons data to explore the variation in density, velocity, and temperature of the solar wind in the outer heliosphere. The activity also allows participants to review the thermal particle energy spectrum measured by NH. (Only one file is required.)

  3) Reconnection Simulation Results - Exploring the structure of reconnection and the impact on kinetics of the plasma particles. (This requires both the Colab Notebook and the accompanying data files with simulation results.) 

4) Turbulence - This activity allows participants to explore turbulence in the solar wind by calculating the power spectrum of the magnetic field components. Results are compared to power laws derived from standard theories of turbulence.  (Only one file is required.)
