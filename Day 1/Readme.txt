This folder contains the lecture slides and activities for Day 1 of the SHIELD Summer School. 
There are four files in this folder; two lecture presentations, a Colab Notebook activity and the results from that activity. The notebooks are setup to run in Google Colab, but they can be modified to run under any Jupyter Notebook environment. 
Here are the file descriptions:
- 2025_Heliosphere_Fundmentals.pdf: Combined efforts of Chika Onubogu, Erick Powell, and Marc Kornbleuth to summarize the structure of the heliosphere and how it is carved out by the solar wind interacting with the interstellar medium. 
- 2025_SHIELD_MHD_V2.pdf by Senbei Du: A short review to Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics and some applications of it including, a description of magnetic pressures and shocks. 
- Lab Activity: Heliosphere_Structures.ipynp - this is an activity that uses a Python notebook to access data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft to explore the plasma properties it sees at various part of the heliosphere.  
- Lab Activity Responses: Heliosphere_Structures_Answers.ipynp - some of the responses to questions raised by the above notebook.
